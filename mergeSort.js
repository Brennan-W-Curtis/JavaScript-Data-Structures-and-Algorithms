//Algorithm Description
//A merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits an unsorted collection into 2 halves
//It sorts the 2 halves, and then merges them together to form one, sorted collection - by using recursion 

//Basics of Merge Sort
//1. It contains a merge function, which actually combines two lists together and sorts them in correct order
//2. There's also a mergeSort function within, which will continue to split the input array and call the merge function again and again
//3. A list with a single item in it is always going to be considered sorted
//4. By splitting up one large, unsorted list down into at least two sorted lists, we can merge them together to create one sorted list
//5. From its individual parts, we can then begin merging those elements together, effectively reconstructing our list into a sorted form
//6. Merging actually referring to is the act of appending an item in a sorted order to a temporary array structure which builds over time
//7. If we multiply the log on n by the value of n, the result ends up being the number of total append operations to perform

//Big O Notation
//Time Complexity - Linearithmic Runtime O(n Log n), given the amount of time that merge sort needs there's clearly aspects of both at play
//Space Complexity - Constant Memory O(1) Out-of-Place, requires a temporary array structure in order to sort and append elements
//Stability - Stable, since it uses a comparison operator, if two elements are equal, it wonâ€™t change their order as it merges them together 
//Internal / External - External, often implemented to sort outside of main memory and then later pull sorted data into main memory
//Recursive / Non-Recursive - Recursive, it relies heavily upon it to divide the unsorted list into smaller sorted lists before merging them
//Comparison Sort - Comparison, since it uses a comparison operator to compare two elements
